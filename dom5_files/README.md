# Dominion 5 Installation

Put your Dominion 5 installation here. For obvious reasons we cannot redistribute the game files themselves, so you have to put the files here manually.

There should be a `data` directory here, along with the dom5 binaries `dom5_amd64`, `dom5_arm`, `dom5_mac`, `dom5_x86`, `Dominion5.exe`, and any required .dll/.so files.

Also needed is `dom5key`.

Simplest is to just copy everything here.
